This repo contains our projects from APPM 2360: Differential Equations and Linear Algebra.

Project 1 is an analysis of a differential equation which models the rate of change of temperature in a building. 

Project 2 explores incomplete singular value decomposition, and applies it to Mariana Trench depth data.
