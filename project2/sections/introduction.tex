\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
The Mariana Trench, lying in the Pacific Ocean between Japan and Papua New Guinea, is the deepest trench in the world. Because of its steep sides and vast depth, the trench provides a unique environment for scientific study. In this project, we will use bathymetric data provided by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to conduct an investigation of the trench. In addition, because this data is often difficult to work with, containing thousands of values, we will explore a means to reduce the size of the data while simultaneously maintaining the structure of the trench. This will allow for further, more computationally intensive investigation.
